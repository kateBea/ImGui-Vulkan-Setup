# ImGui Vulkan Example

This is another project from my spare time about setting up a Vulkan application with Dear ImGui integration, still a work in progress.

## Features

- Vulkan integration: Sets up a Vulkan rendering context for the application.
- ImGui integration: Integrate ImGui for creating user interfaces within the Vulkan application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- CMake (version 3.18 or higher)
- Vulkan SDK
- A C++ 20 capable compiler

## Getting Started

To get started with Vulkan ImGui Starter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/vulkan-imgui-starter.git
```

2. Build the project using CMake:
```bash
cd ImGui-Vulkan-Setup
mkdir build && cd build
cmake --build .
```

3. Run the executable (might need to navigate to the output folder on windows):
```bash
./ImGui-Vulkan-Setup
```
